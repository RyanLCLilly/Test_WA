# Cirrus Salesforce Authentication Flow
## PLEASE NOTE: This is now integrated into the hybrid module that can be found [here](https://github.com/EliLillyCo/CIRR_AUTH_MODULE)

This module contains the Salesforce flow logic for the Cirrus Authentication Module.

**Configuration instructions:**

If you are developing locally, copy the following environment variables into your `.env` file:

**Note:** Changing these from their preset values will break authentication.

```
AUTH_TYPE=sf
SF_AUTHORIZE_URL=https://gso.my.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize
SF_TOKEN_URL=https://gso.my.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token
```

**Also add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:** 

1. `CF_CALLBACK_URL`= The callback URL for your application (e.g. http://myapp.herokuapp.com/auth/callback) this
should be set to the callback URL you configured for your connected app.
2. `CF_CLIENT_ID` = The client ID from your connected app.
3. `CF_CLIENT_SECRET` = The client secret from your connected app.
4. `SESSION_SECRET`= A secure, high entropy key. You can create a value [here](http://randomkeygen.com/)
5. `DISABLE_AUTH_LOGS` = set to `true` to disable auth logs.
6. `AUTH_REQUIRED` = set to `true` to enable auth, `false` to disable auth
