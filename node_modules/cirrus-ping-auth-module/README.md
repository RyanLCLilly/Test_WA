# Cirrus Ping Authentication Flow
## PLEASE NOTE: This is now integrated into the hybrid module that can be found [here](https://github.com/EliLillyCo/CIRR_AUTH_MODULE)

This module contains the Ping flow logic for the Cirrus Authentication Module.


**Configuration instructions:**

If you are developing locally, copy the following environment variables into your `.env` file:

**Note:** Changing these from their preset values will break authentication.

```
AUTH_TYPE=ping
OPENID_ISSUER=https://federate-qa.xh1.lilly.com
OPENID_SCOPE=openid auth_web
OPENID_CALLBACK=/auth/ping/callback
```
**Also add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:**

1. `OPENID_NONCE` = A secure, high entropy key. You can create a value [here](http://randomkeygen.com/)
2. `OPENID_CLIENT_ID`= Your auth client id. this can be found by looking for your `BUSINESS AREA` here: https://cirr-heroku-auth-standards.herokuapp.com.
3. `COOKIE_SECRET`= A secure, high entropy key. You can create a value [here](http://randomkeygen.com/)
4. `DISABLE_AUTH_LOGS` = set to `true` to disable auth logs.
5. `AUTH_REQUIRED` = set to `true` to enable auth, `false` to disable auth


Your application **needs** to follow the naming standards set out here: https://cirr-heroku-auth-standards.herokuapp.com. Your application will not authenticate otherwise and you will get an `invalid uri-redirect` message.
